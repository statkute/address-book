# Address book


This is a web app for managing people and companies' contact information. All entries can be edited and deleted.

### Reasoning behind the functionality
The user can add people and companies. In case the user wants to add people from a certain company, without adding the company itself to the address book, that is made possible. Then, those people will only appear under 'All contacts' tab. If, later on, the user decides to add that company to the Adress book, all of its employees that have already been added to the address book will be assigned to it. To keep the idea of companies and people being managed (in the address book) individually, when a company is deleted from the app, the contacts can still be found under 'All contacts tab'. This is made so that the user would not lose contacts of people who worked/still work at the company. All people contact information is managed separately from the company.
